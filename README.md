## My process

I begin by reading the README provided by the challenge, it gave format info for the styling. I began with the HTML, adding the head content, then the body content which was composed of a class which was the qr-container. Inside of that class, I added the qr image and added a class which contained the text, within the first class. Then, I continued with the CSS. From here, I adjusted the body to be centered and other, and also, the other components like the class and rectify the text such as h1 and p. Also, in the CSS, I added desktop and mobile screens layouts.
